# Pneumonia Detection on X-Ray Images of Chest

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to create a prescreening tool for healthcare providers, particularly in under-resourced areas, to improve diagnostic accuracy and speed. The solution identifies pneumonia and highlights affected regions, offering an explainable AI tool for radiologists.

## Introduction

Pneumonia remains a leading cause of death worldwide, with over 50,000 fatalities in the U.S. in 2015. Accurate diagnosis often requires expert review of chest radiographs (CXRs), which is time-intensive and prone to errors. This project leverages CNN to detect pneumonia from CXRs, aiming to assist radiologists and bridge the gap between advanced diagnostics and accessibility challenges.

## Methods and Approach

### Data Preparation
- Dataset: 30,000 CXR images in DICOM format with bounding box annotations.
- Splitting: 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- Organization: Images separated into directories for efficient data loading.

### Preprocessing
- Resize images to 224Ã—224 pixels.
- Normalize pixel values to [0,1].
- Combine metadata at the patient level for multiple pneumonia regions.
- Binary labels: `0` for no pneumonia, `1` for pneumonia.

### Data Augmentation and Generator Design
- Custom data generator using `keras.utils.Sequence` for dynamic, memory-efficient loading.
- Uniform preprocessing transformations applied across the dataset.

### Model Architecture
- **CNN Enhancements:**
  - L2 Regularization and dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
  - Batch normalization to stabilize training.
  - ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer.
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Binary cross-entropy

### Training and Validation
- **Callbacks:**
  - ModelCheckpoint: Save the best-performing model.
  - EarlyStopping: Prevent overfitting by halting training early.
  - ReduceLROnPlateau: Adjust learning rate when validation loss plateaued.

### Testing and Evaluation
- Metrics: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
- Threshold optimization to balance sensitivity and specificity.

### Visualization and Analysis
- Learning curves: Analyzed convergence and overfitting.
- Performance visualizations: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and accuracy vs. threshold plots.

## Results and Analysis

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Test accuracy: 80%
  - AUC-ROC score: 0.81
  - High specificity but lower sensitivity due to overlapping visual features.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Training and validation loss converged, indicating effective optimization.
  - The confusion matrix showed robust detection of non-pneumonia cases but room for improvement in sensitivity for pneumonia cases.

## Conclusion and Reflection

The project successfully developed a CNN model achieving a test accuracy of 80% and AUC-ROC of 0.81. While the model demonstrated strong performance in detecting non-pneumonia cases, challenges remain in improving sensitivity. Future directions include:
- Addressing class imbalance with augmentation and class weighting.
- Incorporating Grad-CAM for enhanced explainability.
- Expanding the dataset for greater diversity.

This project highlights the potential of AI in medical imaging for timely and accurate diagnoses, particularly in resource-limited settings.
